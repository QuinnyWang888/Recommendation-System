# Specialist in Personalised Music Recommendation Systems

Leveraging the comprehensive Spotify dataset, I embarked on a mission to tailor music recommendations that not only suit a user's individual taste but also their specific listening scenarios.

**Key Highlights**:

**Advanced Data Analysis**: Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, coupled with K-Means clustering, to segment over 170,000 songs based on acoustic features and listening scenarios.

**Personalized Recommendations**: Created unique music clusters such as 'Dynamic Rhythms', 'Calm and Quiet', 'Energetic Joy', and 'Chill and Mellow'. These clusters served as a foundation to offer scenario-specific song recommendations, enhancing the user's overall listening experience.

**Innovative Techniques**: Employed various similarity metrics like Euclidean Distance and Cosine Similarity to gauge the closeness of tracks, ensuring that recommendations were both diverse and aligned with user preferences.

**Continuous Enhancement**: Recognized areas for improvement like the potential of deep learning, the incorporation of temporal, social, and cultural factors, and the need for robust model validation for greater accuracy and efficacy.
